= Glue Sync

The `glue-sync` Lambda helps keep an AWS Glue Datalog in sync with the schema
of the Delta tables for which it receives S3 Event Notifications. Like most
other Lambdas in the oxbow ecosystem it is intended to be triggered with S3
Event Notifications and when a table schema is changed it will load the Delta
table and compare the schema to a Glue Data Catalog entry,. modifying where
necessary.
