= Glue Create

This is a simple Lambda which receives S3 bucket notifications when a new Delta
Lake table is created and creates the appropriate Glue table entry in the data
catalog.

The function exists to handle some of the custom renaming logic to accommodate
the two-layer hierarchy in the AWS Glue Data Catalog (`database` and `table
name`).
