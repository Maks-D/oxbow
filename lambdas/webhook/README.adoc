= Webhook Lmabda

The webhook lambda can help receive JSONL formatted webhook payloads and conver
those into append-only writes to pre-configured Delta tables. It is meant to be
deployed once per Delta table, that is to say that if you need to do ingestion
for multiple Delta tables the best option is to deploy multiple copies of the
Webhook lambda, each with a different configuration.
